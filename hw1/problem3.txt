The program in problem 2, aptly named "printPascalsTriangleFast" in my case, will be faster than problem 1's solution. The reason for this is because problem 1 relies on factorial calculations, which each contain k multiplication operations for k!. Since each value in pascals triangle requires three factorials (and a division), the execution time grows at a staggering rate because we end up doing the same multiplication calculations over and over again. In problem2, however, we only rely on addition operations, which we are able to do by storing already-calculated values in memory.`Not only does this not have any multiplication operations, but we also do not unnecessarily re-calculate values.
